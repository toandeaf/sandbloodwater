## Sand, Blood and Water
![bloodsandwater.png](blood_sand_water_smaller.png)

Living, trading, fighting and dying in the desert. Desert based RPG/life sim written in Rust using the Bevy game engine.

Gameplay inspired by Crusader Kings, The Guild 2, Kenshi, Factorio and numerous economy/management sims. 

Setting inspired by pre-Islamic North African and Middle-Easter nomadic tribes and Frank Herbert's Dune, particularly the Fremen and the sanctity + scarcity of their water.

### Features
* Define how you enter this world: a lone nomad seeking company, fortune or just another day without dying of thirst. The child of a wealthy tribal leader set to inherit power. A slave working on a hemp plantation seeking freedom and a new start.
* Explore the harsh, desert landscape looking for somewhere with fresh water; somewhere to sleep; somewhere to settle; somewhere to exploit or somewhere to thrive. Interact, co-operate or compete with other nomads, tribes, villages or even warlords.
* Hone your skills in scavenging, farming, crafting, fighting, healing or command. Build your reputation and carve out your niche under these oppressive conditions.
* Start a family, inspire your children and designate an heir to take-over your legacy as your body begins to wither into the sand or your blood is spilled by the covetous.
* Live off, steal from or help define the network of desert trade routes that move goods into and out of the desert.
* Be subject to, influence or dictate the behaviour of those around you. Use a combination of fear and respect to improve your standing amongst your peers.
